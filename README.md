***
## 🧬 Introduction
This application comes from "Create a blog software that is completely under my control".
It is mainly based on the T3 Stack and is almost entirely written in Typescript.

The data part of this application is handled by Prisma running on Node. The front-end and back-end data transfers are fully handled by tRPC, which is coordinated by tanstack-query. The front-end framework of the application uses Next.js, which is used as a highly optimized version of React. In addition, styles were developed using Next-UI as well as Tailwind CSS.
